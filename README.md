## Sparsity Solution: Three-Layer Framework

Sparsity's layered approach enables developers to quickly build, certify, and deploy secure TEE applications with minimal friction, leveraging both AWS Nitro Enclaves and advanced compliance and hosting solutions.

see [SPARSITY_OFFERINGS.md](SPARSITY_OFFERINGS.md) for details.

## Pre-requisites: AWS Nitro Enclaves Environment

Before using Sparsity's offerings, ensure you have an AWS Nitro Enclaves environment set up. This includes having an AWS account, configuring Nitro Enclaves on your EC2 instances, and setting up necessary IAM roles and permissions.

see [Setup_Nitro_Enclave_Runtime.md](Setup_Nitro_Enclave_Runtime.md) for details.

## Use enclave-toolkit to build TEE apps
